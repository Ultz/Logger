# This repository is now read-only
This repository contains Ultz Logger 1.X. New versions are now being developed in the joint [Ultz BCL & Platform Extensions](https://github.com/Ultz/Bcl) repository. Newer versions also use the package name and namespace **Ultz.Extensions.Logging**, instead of **Ultz.Logger** (however just this once we have setup a redirect from the [**Ultz.Logger 2.0**](https://nuget.org/packages/Ultz.Logger/2.0) NuGet package to the [**Ultz.Extensions.Logging**](https://nuget.org/packages/Ultz.Extensions.Logging) NuGet package) 

# Logger
An actually good Microsoft logger.
